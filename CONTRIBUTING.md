How to contribute to RichOreVariants
====================================

### Contributor License Agreement

Before pull requests can be accepted, all contributors needs to sign a contributor license agreement. This is to grant us rights for using your code, assets and permission to re-licensing it. For details read the Contributor License Agreement (linked below).

### How do I sign?

To keep the hassle for everyone involved to a minimum, I use CLA Assistant to manage the agreements - you can easily provide a digital signature for this with your GitHub account. You can <a href="https://cla-assistant.io/CosmicDan-Minecraft/RichOreVariants">sign the Contributor License Agreement for RichOreVariants here</a>.

### Why is this needed?

Without a CLA it could become essentially impossible to change or enforce the license of a project which accepts third-party contributions - every contributor would reserve all rights to their contribution and need to be contacted for permissions to modify, re-use or re-license it.

While my mods currently have a custom, slightly restrictive "visible source" license, I do intend to relicense my mods under MIT once I move on from developing them. This is the main reason for the CLA. It also protects me from any contributors who have a change of heart; a CLA signature will invalidate any attempt to withdraw a contribution from the project or extort something out of it in the future.
